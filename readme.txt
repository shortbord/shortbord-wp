The Shortbord plugin allows you to quickly add Shortbord endorsements to your users' comments, authors' post titles, and your
sidebars.

== Description ==

= The problem =

Currently, the only way for people to promote their favorite things online is through spamming their networks with messages 
hoping to drive friends, family and followers to do something. We’ve all received these kinds of messages promoting causes, 
good deals, events and more. But what if there was a better way to build awareness and drive people to action?

= The solution =

A picture is worth 1,000 words. The social web is a big conversation, and through Shortbord, people are able to promote anything 
they want without changing the conversation. This is not annoying and most importantly, its not spam!

= The product = 

Shortbord’s brand icons can go anywhere you post content, thus enabling you to build awareness for your cause within your 
networks as well as to the web at large. Its simple, effective and most importantly, fun.  By installing the Shortbord plugin
you're extending the reach of the Shortbord network and enabling your users to promote their favorite brands and causes just
by participating in your community.

== Installation ==

# Upload the Shortbord plugin to your blog
# Configure the plugin by going to Settings > Shortbord
# Done!

If you wish, you can configure a widget for your site that pulls in your Shortbord endorsements.  Just go to Appearance > Widgets
and configure the Shortbord widget in whatever sidebar you wish.
